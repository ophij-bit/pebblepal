------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 01
A01.1 - initial assignment; variable initialization, message initialization, 
        user input, calculations, if statements, display outputs
A01.2 - string formatting review, identify where optimization may be needed, 
        limit length of label 
A01.3 - adding boolean variable 'is_shiny' for further determination of guess
        of rock type, linked document of rock types used for this program, 
        revised if statements
A01.4 - fixed line length compile error
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 02
A02.1 - re-factored code into functions, converted static messaging into 
        constants, drafted doc-strings
A02.2 - continued refactoring; identifying high coupling and revising 
        appropriately, adding try/except where needed
A02.3 - corrected argument order for results table, extracted rock type 
        densities into constants, updated parameter name for string functions
        to not be confused with built in names
A02.4 - correcting if statement indentation
A02.5 - finishing doc strings, correcting typos
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 03
A03.1 - began implementing menu options; print menu, get option
A03.2 - continued implementing menu options, consolidated functions for 
        user input
A03.3 - implemented sub menu of sample types, contemplated optimization
A03.4 - introduced modules for rock information and for menu options, reduced
        menu generation functions to singular function passed arguments for 
        title, number of options, and option content/labels. Began to break 
        down guess function into type based guess functions containing get 
        functions for each property. Working on density check function that 
        accesses list of possible rocks/minerals in same range as 
        calculated density
A03.5 - clean-up, doc strings, spell-check across files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment 04
A04.1 - added parallel lists for labels and guesses, implemented display
        functions for sample log, introduced new function to display densities
        calculated so far along with information about the average density, 
        and how many samples float/sink/suspend. Updated shorten_string 
        function to account for strings less than 4 chars (need an extra tab
        to align). Added a dens_count variable to count the number of density
        calculations (parallel to 'samples' var).
A04.2 - reset to version A03.5, for the sake of better adhering to the APD, 
        adjusted 'samples' variable to a_count (count of samples analyzed),
        added d_count (count of densities calculated). Added lists for 
        samples analysis branch (a_labels, guesses, facts) and density
        calculator branch (d_labels, masses, volumes). Adjusted 
        analysis branch to append labels and guesses to lists. Adjusted
        density branch to append labels, masses, and volumes to lists.
        differentiated log display functions for samples analysis and 
        densities.
A04.3 - adjusted print_end function to take a_count and d_count to display.
        Updated shorten_string function to add an extra tab if label is below
        maximum length, and add nothing if equal to max len.
A04.3 - reworked menus.py module functions to take an index value and access
        parallel lists for menu titles & option sets. This enabled me to 
        eliminate duplicate functions in main and replace them with generic 
        get_attribute(). Minor formatting adjustments for print intro and 
        print end, added emoji.
A04.4 - reworked density lists in rockfacts.py to utilize parallel lists for 
        common rock/mineral names, lows and highs for density ranges, added 
        two functions to check the density against the lists and pull the 
        matching indices, and a second to print a list using that list of 
        indices
A04.5 - updated doc strings, double checked formatting, cleaned up common
        density comparison lists in rockfacts.py
